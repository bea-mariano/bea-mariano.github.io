#### Introduction to Technical Writing
- In a perfect world, a technical writer or Business Analyst maintains the documentations of the projects.
- Some developers are assigned to write documentations in mid sized software projects.
- Very few developers enjoy documentation.

**Aversion towards Writing Documentation**
- Developers do not think that it's part of their jobs
- Not enough  time due to deadlines and other pressing matters, docs always gets pushed back
- No one reads documentation
- I already know how it works, why bother document it?

**Main Reason: Terrible documentation from Devs**
- Theyre too close to the product
    - Curse of knowledge
    - Hard for a new user
- Write from the developer's perspective not the user's
- Hard to remove bias and assumptions
    - Troubleshooting and bias information gets overlooked

**Why Technical Writing Is Important (Even for Developers)**
1. Marketing: You have to sell your product
    - sales effort
    - developers need to provide workable materials
2. Gets the information out of your head
    - people will stop asking you for it
3. Gets the team on the same page
    - aligns everyone both the client and devs
4. Reduces support calls, makes users happier
    - user guide
    - troubleshooting
5. Auditor might want to know
    - paper trail, decisions, testing, management
6. Direct reflection of you
    - typos, terrible formatting, errors not documented
    - direct reflection of you and your work

**Technical Documentation in Agile Environments**
1. Essential
    - Document with just barely good enough detail
2. Valuable
    - The benefit of having documentation must outweigh the cost of creating and maintaining it 
3. Timely
    - Documentation should be done in a just-in-time manner when we need it

**Overview on Technical Writing**
<br>
<br>
Technical Writing
 - Writing that  helps users solve problems with technologies and technical subject matter
 - Good documentation makes the complex simple
 - Purpose is to get information from the devs to the users

 Common Technical Documents
 - Case Studies, Descriptions, Emails, Letters
 - Instructions and procedures, memos, press releases, proposals, resumes and job applications
 - Specifications, technical reports, white papers, websites

#### The Writing Process
- how you plan, research, write, edit, and release documentation

**Plan**
- Declare purpose, audience (who the readers are), delivery (medium of the documentation)
- **Purpose** - why would the document exist? What is it supposed to accomplish?
    - Pursuade readers to think or act a certain way
    - Enable them to perform a task
    - Help them understand something
    - Change their attitude towards previous versions or the app itself
- **Audience**
- **Delivery**

**Plan: Software Documentation**
1. Requirements - identify what is to be built, and to verify we're meeting stakeholders' expectations
2. Design/Architecture - defines how the system will be constructed, describing critical components and how they fit together
3. Code/Technical - Enable task completion and understanding of other developers
4. Test Plans/Test Cases - define the approach to testing; expose errors or demonstrate correct behaviour
4. End-User Guide - enable task completion; provide support and troubleshooting
